I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisors,  
Professor Jeremy Pitt and Ciske Smit, for their invaluable guidance and  
insight throughout this project. Professor Pitt’s deep expertise in  
socio-technical systems and thoughtful feedback were instrumental in  
framing the research questions and refining the overall direction of  
this work. Ciske’s emphasis on \emph{accessibility for all users} and  
the importance of preserving \emph{user control} over automated  
processes helped to shape both the design of the governance bot and the  
evaluation methodology. I am also grateful to my peers and study  
participants, who engaged enthusiastically with the \emph{Day Out}  
voting scenario and shared valuable feedback that enriched the study.  
Finally, I extend heartfelt thanks to my family and friends for their  
unwavering support and encouragement during the course of this work.
